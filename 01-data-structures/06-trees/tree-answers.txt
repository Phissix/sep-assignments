***Create binary tree and binary heap of 10,000 length***
       user     system      total        real
Binary Search Tree  4.125000   0.000000   4.125000 (  4.129831)
Binary Heap         4.063000   0.000000   4.063000 (  4.091185)
***Finds 5,000th element***
       user     system      total        real
Binary Search Tree  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000511)
Binary Heap         0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000007)
***Deletion***
       user     system      total        real
Binary Search Tree  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000006)
Binary Heap         0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000005)

How much time does an average insertion consume in the Binary Search Tree compared to the Heap?
Both times are nearly identical. Heap search was slightly quicker.

How much time does finding 50000 in the Binary Search Tree consume compared to the Heap?
It takes about 60x longer to find it in the tree compared to the heap.

How much time does the average deletion consume in a Binary Search Tree compared to the Heap?
It takes nearly the same amount of time.

When would you use a Binary Search Tree and why?
I would use a binary search tree if the order and sequence of the data is not required for my solution. It was slightly faster to find and delete nodes.

When would you use an Heap and why?
It would it better to implement a heap if there is a benefit to some ordered arrangement of nodes.
