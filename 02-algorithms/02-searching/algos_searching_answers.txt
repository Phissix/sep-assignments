1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

  It will take 7 iterations to find G using linear search.

2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

  3 iterations to find G using binary search.

3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.

  0, 1, (0+1) 1, (1+1) 2, (1+2) 3, (2+3) 5, (3+5) 8, (5+8) 13, (8+13) 21, (13+21) 34, (21+34) 55, 89 (34+55)
  fib(10) = 34
  fib(11) = 55
  fib(12) = 89

4. Scores for iterative vs recursive fibonacci:

***fib(20)***
       user     system      total        real
Iterative  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000010)
Recursive  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000008)

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

  Since the collection is unsorted, the search may not be able to find the target value in a binary search. In this case, linear search would be optimal.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

  Recursive binary search would be more optimal in this case.
  A binary search will decrease the amount of iterations to find the target value and
  a recursive search is slightly quicker than an iterative search.
